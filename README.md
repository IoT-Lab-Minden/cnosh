# cnosh
**An intelligent cat food dispenser based on an ESP32-Microcontoller.**

In this repository the cnosh will be created by [Dario](https://github.com/dleunig) and [Alex](https://github.com/abergy) for the elective "Embedded-Software" on the FH-Bielefeld.

For a better overview we linked all diagrams and documents that we created in the [GitHub- Wiki](https://github.com/IoT-Lab-Minden/cnosh/wiki). Everything here is under development and will be updated regularly.
